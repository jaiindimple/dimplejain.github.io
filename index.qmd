## About

Geospatial Engineer at **Pixxel**, working with hyperspectral imagery, geospatial data processing, and automation, while bridging the gap between software engineering and geospatial solutions.

Background in **Geography & Geoinformatics**, with hands-on experience in software development, satellite data analysis, and scalable geospatial systems.

Passionate about open-source geospatial technologies, automation, and building scalable geospatial solutions.

I've presented at open-source conferences like **FOSS4G 2023** on [Open Data for Geospatial](https://youtu.be/nKxouMKOJjk?si=A0YmiKOCbwPSDidb) and **FOSS4G Asia Seoul** on [PyQGIS](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-asia-2023/talk/8KDVRF/).

I also presented at [QGIS Open Day Jan 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqIwEyuqH-Q) and attended **STAC Sprint 2023 in the USA**, where I began contributing to open-source projects by writing documentation on [STAC tutorial](https://github.com/jaiindimple/stac-site).
